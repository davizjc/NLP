# NLP Text Classification Project README
## Overview
This project involves classifying text data using machine learning and natural language processing techniques. Multiple models are explored, including Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machines (SVM), and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). The project is implemented in Python, using libraries like TensorFlow, scikit-learn, and NLTK.
## Requirements
1. Python 3.x
1. OpenCV (cv2)
1. Natural Language Toolkit (nltk)
1. Gensim (gensim)
1. PyTesseract (pytesseract)
1. pdf2image
1. PyThaiNLP (pythainlp)
1. SpellChecker
## Configuration
Two configuration paths need to be set up in the script:
1. POPPLER_PATH: Path to the Poppler utility, required for converting PDF pages to images.
2. pytesseract.pytesseract.tesseract_cmd: Path to the Tesseract executable, required for OCR.
